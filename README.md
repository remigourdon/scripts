# scripts

The awkward-at-first naming convention, with all script names starting with a comma, is a result of me coming across [this old post](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/).
It can be seen as a simple way to namespace my personal scripts which leads to:

* virtually no risk of having my personal script names conflict with other programs
* a quick way to have a look at the list of scripts from the command line by simply entering `,<TAB>`
